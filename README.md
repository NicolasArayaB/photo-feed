This is my very first project in 4Geeks Academy.

This was thought to practice my beginner HTML/CSS skills. On this project will be exercising the following concepts:

Reusing CSS classes.
Display and Position CSS Rules.
Building a layout with CSS/HTML.
Centering containers.
Flow left and right.
Importing images.
